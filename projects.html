    <p class = "centred-paragraph">
      <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source </a>is a model of development where the source code is not only publicly available but

      In all of these projects input from anyone who wants to get involved would be great so contact me or pull the repo.

      Most of the projects I do for myself fit into this category because I try to write as much of my code open source as possible.

     <p>
       Hive Mind Mob is an early-development open-source game for PC in which players control a hive-minded group within a simulated modern-day society.
       The society grows and develops with the player's influence and the influence of many other non-player entities, and the designs have a major focus
       on the effect of technological development, which has drastic impacts on the player's surroundings and abilities as time progresses.

     <h3><a href="https://gitlab.com/calummackervoy/goap-igpu">Dissertation</a></h3>
     <p>
       Used OpenCL to produce a distributed version of <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html">Goal Oriented Action Planning</a> (GOAP)
       which is essentially a method to model an AI with pathfinding. GOAP has been known to present tremendous benefits to the AI of a game, but it has
       the unfortunate property of using lots of the CPUs resources which an AI system rarely has in abundance.
       The software was deployed on the iGPU and GPU devices with each core acting as a single agent. The theory was that executing it on the higher-spec GPU would only
       be beneficial if it wasn't also responsible for rendering, but that executing on an idle integrated graphics processor (iGPU) would improve performance when the GPU was handling rendering.
       The results reflected this.
