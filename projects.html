     <p>
       Hive Mind Mob is an in-development open-source game for PC in which players control a hive-minded group within a simulated modern-day society.
       The society grows and develops with the player's influence and the influence of many other non-player entities, and the game has a major focus
       on the effect of technological development, which has drastic impacts on the player's surroundings and abilities as time progresses.

      If you have a project in mind please do not hesitate to contact me. Refer to this section and the following section on education for my experience,
      although I am a fast learner if you have projects which do not 1:1 correlate to anything listed.
