<h2 id="cooperatives">Cooperatives</h2>

<p>Alongside my freelance activities and professional projects, during my career I have been active in the establishment
    and growth of numerous cooperative businesses.</p>

<p id="code-operative">
    In July 2018 I cofounded <a href="https://code-operative.co.uk" target="_blank">Code-Operative</a>, the first tech
    freelancers co-operative to be founded in the North East of England.
    Code-Operative's mission was to grant its members a greater degree of autonomy over their economic lives - both by
    exposing new people to the benefits of freelancing and in exposing freelancers to the benefits of mutualisation
    within the co-operative model, via a greater degree of security and autonomy in their work and via a support
    network. Our clients were tech-for-good, typically themselves co-operatives or non-profit organisations.
    Between 2018 and 2023 I was an active member of the co-operative and helped to establish its articles of
    association, mission, business model, first clients and the governance model.

<p id="cotech">
    <b>CoTech</b> is a network of ethical co-operatives from across the UK providing technology, digital and creative

    Between 2019 and 2023 I was an active member in organising the networkâ€™s activities, for example arranging the <a

    which was attended by around 60 people.
