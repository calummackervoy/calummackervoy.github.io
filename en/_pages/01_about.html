        I am a developer based in Paris who can provide solutions for a variety of different purposes. I have a wide variety of experience, covering web, mobile and games development. I graduated from Newcastle University with a First Class with Honours degree in Computer Science in 2017, and I've been self-employed since. I've worked on projects for governments and for ambitious startups, on cutting-edge open-source projects and on emerging web standards.

        I conduct personal research, particularly concerning the semantic web. Much of my code is open-source. I have experience organising in co-operatives, I'm particularly interested in social technics, the semantic web and the commons. I like writing and making games, too. My <a href="{{ '/blog' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Blog</a> is a good place to read more about my activities.
