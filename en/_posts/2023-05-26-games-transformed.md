Hello! This post is made as an introduction to our Games Transformed submission, Realm. The jam theme is collective action and the objective is to make anti-capitalist games. So we made a game commons. Following on from past experiments, in this game players submit their own characters to be played as cards using an open standard which can be interoperable with other games. I'll get back to this, for now the best way to show you this is for you to play it.

Please start by making a card at the following URL: [https://mud-card-generator.netlify.app/](https://mud-card-generator.netlify.app/). Please use images that are 512x512 (sorry, we ran out of time!)

Now it's in the game!

If you're at the event, give it a go on the arcade machine, or if you're at home then give it a go in the browser from the [Itch.io page](https://calummackervoy.itch.io/realm).

In the game you choose to give cards to the deck of one AI player or the other, and watch the battle play out. You might notice that some of the stuff that happens is unexpected, like a Bog Monster eating villagers from a place called Withering Heights or a knight deciding to pack it in and become a teacher. These actions happen because the characters are interacting with their world and have actions and events defined on them which impact the wider world. The data is represented in Linked Data and follows an open standard which can be understood by other games and shared as the game is played and not at developer-time.

If you enjoyed making a card for the game and you're wondering how you can add to and enrich your character, or how you can add more complex spells and actions like eating nearby villagers, at this stage you'll need to get your hands dirty with writing JSON. If you're not scared away, then checkout out the [documentation for creating cards](https://github.com/Multi-User-Domain/games-transformed-jam-2023/blob/master/docs/create.md).

Hopefully now I've shed some light on what is implicated by a "game in common" - the features, characters and worlds can be shared, and games can mutually benefit from doing so. It has the potential to be like Wikipedia for game worlds. For this jam we kept the scope to a simple card game, in later jams we plan to expose your characters to [text adventure games](https://calum.mackervoy.com/en/2022/08/26/ud-engine.html), and allow you to use them across games in interesting, cross-polinating ways. Everything is open source, if you're interested in following this project into the future and _especially_ if you're interested in contributing, then please let us know and [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/sauZA3jCK7).
