In older blog posts I've explored [the wider possibilities of decentralised games running on the semantic web](https://calum.mackervoy.com/en/2021/04/23/mud.html), but I'll briefly introduce it here. Since 2021 I've been playing around with the use of [linked data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) to enable games to share content and features. The long-term goal is to build a game in common, where I'm able to publish a character, or meet one in a text-adventure game, use it as a card in a card game and find when I take it back to the text adventure game the experiences in the card game have _changed_ the character. So then it's an ecosystem of games which build on top of each other and choose to share things with one another.

In this demonstration, I made a pretty basic city-building-like game which lets you place characters and buildings down in a map using cards. You can then play a card which turns one of the characters into a vampire. A GIF of the result is below.

In a 2D city-building game using cards, a card is played on one of the characters in the village, called 'Vampiric Bite'. After being played the character is transformed into a vampire." />

What you are looking at, and what is really cool about this - is that the card I played was read from linked data (i.e. it could be pulled from any server) representing the action "Vampire Bite" - the bite which turns someone into a vampire.

Currently the ["Vampiric Bite" action](https://github.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab/blob/main/examples/actionOutcomeAsCard.json) describes an action which turns a character into a vampire. It includes basic information about the description and depiction of the action, and indicates that it can be played as a card via the property-value `implementsSpecification: playableCard`. Via `playTarget` it indicates it should only be played on characters, and via the `patchesOnComplete` it describes to the game how to change the world state so that the change is made (making the character a vampire). The next steps will be to add restrictions to playing the card via shapes and to [separate the consequences of an aciton](https://github.com/Multi-User-Domain/SimPolis/issues/2) from the action itself so that it can have different effects depending on the context (e.g. if a vampire drinks the blood of the dead or dying, then the vampire itself dies).

The code is all available on GitHub. The game itself is from a game I'm calling [Sim Polis](https://github.com/Multi-User-Domain/SimPolis), and most of the specification is from the [Multi-User-Domain vocabularies](https://github.com/Multi-User-Domain/vocab) which I've been developing. To get context in the vocabularly in particular check out the issues and the Wiki.
