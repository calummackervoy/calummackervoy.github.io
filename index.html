        <h2>What I do...</h2>
        <p>
            I provide solutions for apps, websites, games, systems and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can help with existing projects or manage development from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am well-connected with other developers in the area, and frequently collaborate with others. This means
            that I can provide for bigger projects and bring in developers with specialist skills.
