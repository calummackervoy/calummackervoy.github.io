            I am a developer based in Paris who can provide solutions for a variety of different purposes. I have a
            wide
            variety of experience, covering web, mobile and games development. I graduated from Newcastle University
            with a First Class with Honours degree in Computer Science in 2017, and I've been self-employed since.
            I've
            worked on projects for governments and for ambitious startups, on cutting-edge open-source projects and
            on
            emerging web standards.

            I conduct personal research, particularly concerning the semantic web. Much of my code is open-source. I
            have extensive experience organising in co-operatives and in free software. I'm particularly interested
            in
            social technics, the semantic web and the commons. I like writing and making games, too. My <a

            activities.

<h2 id="cooperatives">Cooperatives</h2>

<p>Alongside my freelance activities and professional projects, during my career I have been active in the
    establishment
    and growth of numerous cooperative businesses.</p>

<p id="code-operative">
    In July 2018 I cofounded <a href="https://code-operative.co.uk" target="_blank">Code-Operative</a>, the
    first tech
    freelancers co-operative to be founded in the North East of England.
    Code-Operative's mission was to grant its members a greater degree of autonomy over their economic lives -
    both by
    exposing new people to the benefits of freelancing and in exposing freelancers to the benefits of
    mutualisation
    within the co-operative model, via a greater degree of security and autonomy in their work and via a support
    network. Our clients were tech-for-good, typically themselves co-operatives or non-profit organisations.
    Between 2018 and 2023 I was an active member of the co-operative and helped to establish its articles of
    association, mission, business model, first clients and the governance model.

<p id="cotech">
    <b>CoTech</b> is a network of ethical co-operatives from across the UK providing technology, digital and
    creative
    services.
    Between 2019 and 2023 I was an active member in organising the networkâ€™s activities, for example arranging
    the <a href="https://wiki.coops.tech/wiki/Newcastle_2019" target="_blank">November Gathering event in
        Newcastle</a>
    which was attended by around 60 people.
    More information can be found <a href="https://coops.tech/" target="_blank">on the CoTech website</a>, or <a
        href="https://community.coops.tech/" target="_blank">on the CoTech forum</a>

<p id="gamescommons">
    <a href="https://gamescommons.com/" target="_blank">Games Commons</a> is a new way to conceive of game
    design based
    on principles from the commons economy and on the semantic web.
    The flagship project, Sim Polis, is a game about making and breaking systems that is being built using
    <b>Godot</b>
    (GDScript and .NET), <b>Flask/Python</b> and <b>MongoDB</b>.
