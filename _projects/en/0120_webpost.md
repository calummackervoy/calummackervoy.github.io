**Node.js Development** for Webpost Ltd. Wrote a simple server to select a random sample of patients and ensure duplicate letters are not sent twice, alongside other tools and features. Deployed live today within several NHS practices in the Doncaster region.

In another project, I worked with Webpost to produce a proof-of-concept **desktop Java application** allowing users to manage mail sending via a JavaFX interface.
