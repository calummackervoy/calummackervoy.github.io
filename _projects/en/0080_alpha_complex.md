**Full Stack Web Development** and **Mobile App Development** for The Alpha Complex Ltd. Designed and orchestrated the full business use-case across three codebases, including a cross-platform mobile application (iOS and Android) allowing users to submit mental health data, a web portal for viewing and creating health reports, using a Django Python backend. As the app is being used for commercial clients including the NHS and during the trial devices would be shared in-house, security and privacy was essential, not just from outside sources but also in protecting anonymity from management in the generated reports.
