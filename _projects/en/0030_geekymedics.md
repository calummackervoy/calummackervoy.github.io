Geeky Medics are a community-first education platform for doctors and medical professionals in the UK. As part of a small team and over a period of two years I provided **Django Python and JavaScript development** as well as consultancy and lead development roles on both the maintenance of the platform and the development of new features for the mobile API and web application. Some of the features (such as the Virtual Patient) were the first of their kind released to market in the world.
