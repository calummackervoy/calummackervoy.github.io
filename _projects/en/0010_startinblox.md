Startinâ€™Blox offers its clients a suite of tools built on an extension of the Django framework for building applications quickly for the semantic web. To this end I worked primarily on the core DjangoLDP libraries, <a href="https://git.startinblox.com/djangoldp-packages" target="_blank">published with an MIT license</a>. I needed to work with core aspects of the Django framework, and with emerging web standards and protocols like ActivityStreams, Linked Data Protocol and SOLID. My work also involved supporting a range of clients who use the libraries, working with stakeholders of varied technical capabilities communicating in both English and French.
