Developed an **Automated Billing System** for Karma Computing Ltd. Worked on a large-scale project to create an automated system for managing customer services & payments using third-party services. The code was written to be generic for use by any company selling a service which requires instant and recurring payments, using PHP, Node.js and Python modules.

In another project I worked with Karma Computing as a **MySQL and PostgreSQL Database Engineer** to assist them in a large-scale database migration involving large quantities of data from an old system to one which was radically restructed and stored with a different DBMS.
