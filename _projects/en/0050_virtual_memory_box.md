**Django Python Development** for Nebula Labs Ltd and a range of UK local government councils. Collaborated with Nebula Labs to produce the database, admin site and API for an early version of an <a href="https://nebulalabs.co.uk/virtual-memory-box-wins-prestigious-award/" target="_blank">award winning</a> web-based application which allows users to connect with their Care Workers, store memories, arrange appointments together, interact and provide feedback. AAA accessibility was crucial, and as the application stored sensitive data about children, privacy and security were essential. Developed aspects of the front-end using Django templates. The userbase is growing and recently this application surpassed the milestone of 10,000 children using it with their carers in 20 different UK councils.
