Nebula Labs are a software development company based in the North East of England with whom I have had the pleasure of collaborating on numerous other projects:
* **Full Stack Web Development** using **Graphene**, **GraphQL** and **Python** for Nebula Labs Ltd, involving the management of complex, anonymised data.
* **Django Python Development** to develop an API for a nutrition app using Django 3.2 and the Open Food Facts API. Features were focussed on the creation of bespoke user profiles, nutritional intake and guidance.
* **Cross-Platform Mobile App Development with Ionic** Newcastle International Film Festival and More Cobalt Studios.
