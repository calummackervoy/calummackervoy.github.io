Nebula Labs are a software development company based in the North East of England with whom I have had the pleasure of collaborating on numerous other projects:
* **Django Python Development** using **Graphene** and **GraphQL** for the management of complex, anonymised data.
* **Django Python Development** producing an API for a nutrition app leveraging Open Food Facts. Features were focussed on the creation of bespoke user profiles, nutritional intake and guidance.
* **Cross-Platform Mobile App Development with Ionic** Newcastle International Film Festival and More Cobalt Studios.
