**Django Python Development**, systems and semantic application design as part of an international collaboration between Open Food Network, Data Food Consortium and Coop Circuits, made for sharing data across hundreds of cooperatives and food producers from across Canada, France and the UK using emerging web technologies which empower individuals and the commons, towards a more cooperative web designed to work for everyone. I worked on designing standards based on semantic web technologies and the DFC ontologies, and on developing Django software across a network of different servers using these bespoke standards and emerging standards such as WebID-OIDC.
