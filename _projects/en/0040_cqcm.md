**Django Python Development** of an application built on emergent semantic web technologies as part of an international collaboration between Open Food Network, Data Food Consortium and Coop Circuits. Involving many stakeholders, the application was built for sharing data across hundreds of cooperatives and food producers from across Canada, France and the UK. The design principles and technology choices were made to empower individuals and the commons, towards a more cooperative web designed to work for everyone. My work was built on existing standards from the W3C and DFC, expanding upon and deploying across a network of different servers authenticated by Keycloak, WebID-OIDC and providing a system for sharing data with fine-grained permission controls.
