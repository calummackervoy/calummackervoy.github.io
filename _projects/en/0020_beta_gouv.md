Beta.gouv is an initiative financed by the French government around the concept of a “government start-up”, backed with the finance and scale of one of the world’s biggest economies but with the dynamism and fresh perspective of the start-up world. My work during this term was with a large team in the Plateforme de l’inclusion, where I worked on a website used by people in need of inclusive/accessible work, such as handicapped people and ex-prisoners. This was my first position where the only language used in all communications was French.
